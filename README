FSBA - Filesystem Based Administration
======================================

FSBA is an extension above the shell layer to allow directory oriented
Unix remote administration. This software was started as part of my master
thesis published at: http://mischa.mailq.de/thesis.pdf (German only)

This software is a prototype implementation.

Installation instructions can be found in the thesis document at chapter 5.5
